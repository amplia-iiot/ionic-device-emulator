Simple Device Emulator to exchange data using the OpenGate south RESTful API

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about ionic [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/):
* Cordova - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.

First, we will go and install the most recent version of Apache Cordova, which will take our app and bundle it into a native wrapper to turn it into a traditional native app.

#Install Cordova
make sure you have Node.js installed, then run

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g cordova
```

#Install Ionic
Ionic comes with a convenient command line utility to start, build, and package Ionic apps.

To install it, simply run:


```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```
